#   Welcome to this code, I hope you'll enjoy it

# purpose: PasswordSecurityCheck from terminal
# status: in progress
# %% we will be using the website's pwnedpasswords.com API
#    it uses k-anonymity, so you only have to give it the first 5 letters of the hash
#    and then you get back the matching hashes, all of them, so they can't know your
#    specific search, which is pretty smart
#
#    run the python file in the IDE or the exe file in the dist folder
#
#    in case of execution in terminal - some code needs to be un(commented)
#    > python main.py <password_to_check>

# %% ################ Imports ####################
# main functionality for API requests and hashing
import requests
import hashlib
# for the optional terminal call with pw as arguments
import sys
# for the optional window termination countdown:
import time
# for coloring the output on the terminal:
from colorama import init
from termcolor import colored


# ################### Functions ####################
# this function is responsible for fetching the hashed password tails that match your pw-tail
def api_data_request(query_chars):
    pw_url = 'https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/' + query_chars

    api_response = requests.get(pw_url)
    if api_response.status_code != 200:
        raise RuntimeError(f'Error fetching: {api_response.status_code}, check API and try again.')

    # print(api_response.text)
    # in the response.text you get all the tails: #hacked, like this:
    # EDAFA574EEB5A77322D4C6150FAA4A41816:1
    # EE38120FCCCD99F6F5CF32812C15CA2B1FB:34
    # EE606898F30C5C473736BFDAC262955137F:3

    return api_response


# this one counts the number of times the pw has been leaked
def get_pw_leaks_count(hashes, hash_to_check):
    split_hashes = (line.split(':') for line in hashes.text.splitlines())
    for hsh, count in split_hashes:
        if hsh == hash_to_check:
            return count
    return 0


# the following function requires the following steps:
# first you encode the pw in utf-8: b'hello'
# then you create a sha1 HASH object out of it: <sha1 HASH object @ 0x0380CE10>
# hexdigest creates: 'aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d'
# contains only hex digits, can be sent securely over mail
# then convert to upper case: 'AAF4C61DDCC5E8A2DABEDE0F3B482CD9AEA9434D'

# this function prepares the password for the request and also calls the counting fct
def pwned_api_check(password):
    # prepare the password
    sha1password = hashlib.sha1(password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest().upper()
    # save first 5 chars and tail:
    first5chars, tail = sha1password[:5], sha1password[5:]
    # print('first5chars:', first5chars, 'tail:', tail)
    # print('sha1password:', sha1password)

    # pass the 5 chars to the request function:
    response = api_data_request(first5chars)

    # print('response:', response)
    # print('tail:', tail)
    # <Response [200]>
    return get_pw_leaks_count(response, tail)
    # you need to pass the tail because that's what you get from the API!
